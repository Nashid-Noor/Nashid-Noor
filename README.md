## Hi, I’m Nashid 👋

AI Engineer building production-grade agentic and multimodal systems.

I design and deploy intelligent systems that combine Large Language Models, structured agent workflows, and production-ready backend services — transforming research ideas into reliable, real-world AI applications.

🎓 MSc Artificial Intelligence (Distinction), University of Surrey  
🏢 Former Senior Software Engineer at Wipro (Enterprise Telecom Systems)  
⚙️ Building agentic systems, retrieval-augmented AI applications, and multimodal solutions

## 🚀 What I Build

### 🧠 Agentic AI Systems
- Designed multi-step agent workflows using LangGraph with controlled execution flow  
- Built tool-calling systems with strict JSON schema validation (Pydantic)  
- Developed autonomous research and reasoning pipelines with live web integration  
- Added structured output validation to reduce hallucinations and formatting errors  

### 🔎 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Hybrid retrieval systems combining dense vectors and BM25 lexical search  
- Worked with FAISS, Qdrant, pgvector, and Pinecone  
- Implemented structured document parsing and table-aware chunking  
- Built source-grounded financial and enterprise document QA systems  

### ⚡ Production LLM Infrastructure
- Developed FastAPI-based inference services  
- Used AsyncIO for concurrent model execution  
- Containerized deployments using Docker  
- Optimised latency through caching, batching, and response-time tuning  

### 👁 Computer Vision + LLM Systems
- Built object detection pipelines using YOLOv8  
- Implemented Vision–Language models (CLIP, prompt tuning)  
- Developed end-to-end CV + RAG applications  

### 🧪 Model & Architecture Engineering
- Implemented BERT, Vision Transformer, CLIP, and ResNet from scratch  
- Built custom LoRA modules for parameter-efficient fine-tuning  
- Designed reproducible experiment pipelines and ablation studies
